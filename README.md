# MoveCli 

You can Publish and run move functions using a user friendly interface.

You will get a icon on the sidebar which would enable you run, compile, publish, test and also fund your account.
When you click on run, a window would open where you can enter the arguments along with the type which is displayed as a dropdown.

The comands will run in the terminal so if there is no active terminal, it will create one for you.

Please open the folder containing the move modules with move.toml for the extension to work properly.
