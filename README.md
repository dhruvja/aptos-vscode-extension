# MoveCli 

You can Publish and run move functions using a user friendly interface.

Just Enter `CMD + SHIFT + P` and search for `Run Commands` which would open a webview where you can enter the details and run the commands.

The comands will run in the terminal so if there is no active terminal, it will create one for you.

Please open the folder containing the move modules with move.toml for the extension to work properly.
